            International Teams
        </h1>
        This is a list of the men's national association football teams in the world. The International 
        Association Football Federation (FIFA) is the world's most important governing body for association
        football. A majority of national association football teams in the world are members of FIFA or one 
        of its affiliated continental confederations. A majority of them also represent sovereign states with 
        wide international recognition, with 188 of 195 United Nations (UN) member and observer states holding
        membership of FIFA. A notable exception is the United Kingdom, which is not a member of FIFA in its own
        right but is represented in the governing body by the teams of its four constituent countries. Other UN
        members and one observer state have either held membership in a confederation in the past and subsequently
        lost it, or have never belonged to either FIFA or one of its recognised confederations.

        Membership of FIFA and its confederations also includes national teams representing a few states with limited
        international recognition, one associated state with no UN membership, a significant number of dependent territories,
        and a limited number of autonomous areas. A majority of states with limited recognition, however, have no membership
        of FIFA or any of its confederations..

            Membership criteria of FIFA and affiliated confederations
        </h1>
        Historically, the majority of FIFA and confederation members have been sovereign states with wide diplomatic
        recognition. Exceptions to this rule have included the British Home Nations (due to their seminal role in the
        development of football), Palestine (accepted into FIFA after the creation of the Palestinian National Authority)
        ,[17] the Republic of China (which does not enjoy wide recognition but is still accepted as representative of the
        Taiwan area), and certain dependent territories, autonomous areas, and protectorates which, on the grounds of their
        political autonomy, separate status, and/or distance from their parent state, have been allowed to hold membership in
        FIFA and/or one of its affiliated confederations. At present, FIFA members include 23 subnational and dependent territories,
        as well as three states with limited international recognition.[note 3] A further nine overseas, dependent, and autonomous 
        territories with close ties to a sovereign state do not have membership in FIFA, but are members of one of its affiliated
        confederations (either in a full or associate capacity).
